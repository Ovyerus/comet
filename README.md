# Comet

> Music on ATProto.

Comet's goal is to provide an open, decentralised alternative for uploading and
sharing your music with others.

Follow along on Bluesky! [@comet.sh](https://bsky.app/profile/comet.sh) /

This project is in the _very_ early stages and a lot will change over time,
especially as this is my first foray into the ATProtocol ecosystem. Stuff will
be a bit messy for a while. Feel free to contribute and voice your opinions!
